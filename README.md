# Dining Vlosophers

This is my implementation in V-lang. V is super similar to Go, and if you have experience in Go, learning V should be a breeze. This is the first program I've ever written in V and it was still quite easy (though I'm sure there are problems). V is Go but with immutability by default, better control of struct behavior, some optional polymorphism, and rust-like error handling. V is not nearly ready for production though unfortunately, so Go will remain my preferred language for projects suitable for these types of languages.
